# HTML-and-CSS-projects
A place for me to store all of my HTML and CSS projects

This GitHub repository will contain all projects I create that are written in HTML and CSS. A majority of the projects that I will be storing on here will be assignments given to me from The Tech Academy.

# Projects
One Page Website

This project can be found in my repository as one-page-website.html. This project is a very basic and simple HTML website. It includes a fully functional Nav bar 
and is styled minimally with CSS.


Space Station Resort

This project is named index.html in my repository. The focus of this project was to create a responsive and stylized HTML website. All style elements were done using CSS.

Academy Cinemas

The Academy Cinemas project can be found in my repository as academy.cinemas.html
This project was styled with bootstrap4 and was designed to look like a website for a movie theater. This project was stylized entirely with bootstrap4.

Portfolio Website

This website is located in another repository but can be accessed through this URL https://ghvp.github.io
This website was created to show case my understanding of HTML and CSS. This project also includes a functonal form in which viewers of my webpage can
submit their contact information.
