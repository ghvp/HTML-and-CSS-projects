# HTML-and-CSS-projects
A place for me to store all of my HTML and CSS projects

This GitHub repository will contain all projects I create that are written in HTML and CSS. A majority of the projects that I will be storing on here will be assignments given to me from The Tech Academy.

# Projects
One Page Website

This project can be found in my repository as one-page-website.html. This project is a very basic and simple HTML website. It includes a fully functional Nav bar 
and is styles very minimally with CSS

Academy Cinemas

The Academy Cinemas project can be found in my repository as academy.cinemas.html
This project was styled with bootstrap4 and was designed to look like a website for a movie theater. This project was stylized entirely with bootstrap4.
